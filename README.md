# KoboltCPP Webapp

This is a lightweight web application that serves as a quick access portal to the KoboldCPP Colab notebook.

## Purpose

KoboldCPP is a powerful tool for running large language models locally via Colab. However, constantly switching between browser tabs can be inconvenient â€” especially during testing or extended use. This webapp simplifies the process by offering a single interface that directly loads the KoboldCPP Colab page.

> **Note:** This project does not host or modify any part of KoboldCPP itself.

## Features

- Embedded display of the official [KoboldCPP Colab notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/github/lostruins/koboldcpp/blob/concedo/colab.ipynb)
- Minimal interface for a focused experience
- No ads, trackers, or custom assets
